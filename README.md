Psychic Game
This game pulls from an array of every letter in the alphabet and has the user guess a letter.
The computer compares the user guess to the computer guess.  If they are the same the user score goes up and the game resets,
if they are different then the guess left counter goes down, if it reaches 0 then the computer score goes up and the game resets.
